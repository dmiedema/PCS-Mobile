## Developer Portal and Xcode Basics
In this class we will cover the Apple developer portal and Xcode basics. The Apple developer portal is one of the most upsetting and frustrating parts of development but it is one of, if not the most important piece. Apple is big on security so there are more steps involved in signing an app and distributing than there are for an android app. Xcode is a great IDE (Integrated Development Environment) but since you have probably never used it before, we will cover the way it is laid out and what specific things do.
